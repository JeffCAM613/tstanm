# 10 — Test log

Running record of every execution against a real database: what was run, what happened, what broke,
and what was changed as a result.

Kept in the repo rather than in a ticket so that the reason for each fix stays next to the code.

## Session 1 — TANM7881, 2026-08-13

| | |
|---|---|
| Database | TANM7881 — personal/disposable instance, recreatable |
| Oracle server | 19c Enterprise Edition 19.24.0.0.0 |
| sqlplus client | 19.28.0.0.0 |
| Code location | `C:\Users\u735031\Desktop\WORK_DIR\Projects\Test_Anonymization` |
| Config | `anonymization.ini`, `DATA` for both data and index tablespaces, passwords left blank |
| Stage reached | **A1 — blocked, then fixed** |

### Result summary

| Stage | Result |
|---|---|
| A0 — prerequisites | ✅ PASS — sqlplus present, connected as OP |
| A1 — metadata schema | ❌ **FAIL** — two defects, both fixed below |
| A2 — engine compile | ⛔ blocked by A1 |
| B–G | ⏳ not started |

---

### Defect T1 — `MODE` is an Oracle reserved word 🔴 BLOCKER — fixed

```
ORA-00904: "MODE": invalid identifier
ORA-06512: at line 8
```

**Where:** `op/sql/10_create_metadata_schema.sql`, `anon_run` table definition.

**Cause:** the column was named `mode`. `MODE` is on Oracle's reserved word list (it is the keyword
in `LOCK TABLE … IN EXCLUSIVE MODE`), so it cannot be used as a column name unquoted.

**Consequence:** `anon_run` was never created. Because the sequence `seq_anon_run` is created in the
same PL/SQL block *after* the table, it was not created either — and three later `GRANT` statements
then failed with `ORA-00942` because their target did not exist. **Four of the five reported errors
were downstream of this one.**

**Fix:** renamed the column `mode` → `run_mode`, in four places:

| File | What |
|---|---|
| `op/sql/10_create_metadata_schema.sql` | column definition and the `ck_anon_run_mode` check constraint |
| `op/sql/30_install_engine.sql` | the `INSERT` in `start_run` |
| `op/verify/verify_op_coverage.sql` | `WHERE run_mode = 'EXECUTE'` when reading back `MIN_CODE_LENGTH` |
| `tests/manual/monitor_op_progress.sql` | `SELECT` list and `COLUMN` format |

Renamed rather than quoted as `"MODE"`: a quoted identifier stays case-sensitive forever and every
future query has to quote it too.

**Why it was not caught earlier:** nothing in this package had been compiled against Oracle. Reserved
words are exactly the class of error that only a real parser finds — no amount of reading catches it.

**Audit done as a result:** checked every column name in all eight metadata tables against Oracle's
reserved word list. `MODE` was the only one. `RULE`, `SOURCE`, `PART`, `DETAIL`, `PHASE`, `LEVEL` and
`STATUS` are keywords but not reserved, and the tables using them created without error — which the
test output independently confirms.

---

### Defect T2 — view owner had no privilege on the table it reads 🟠 fixed

```
ORA-00942: table or view does not exist
```
…on `CREATE OR REPLACE VIEW atrace.ref_tables_modif`.

**Where:** `op/sql/10_create_metadata_schema.sql`, EPF compatibility view.

**Cause:** the view belongs to `atrace` but selects from `anon_meta.code_map`. A view compiles with
its **owner's** rights, not the creator's, so SYS creating it is not sufficient — `atrace` needed its
own `SELECT` privilege on `anon_meta.code_map`. It had none.

`WITH GRANT OPTION` is required as well, because the next statement is
`GRANT SELECT ON atrace.ref_tables_modif TO op` — `atrace` can only pass on a privilege it holds
grantable.

**Fix:** added before the view is created:

```sql
GRANT SELECT ON anon_meta.code_map TO atrace WITH GRANT OPTION;
```

**Worth noting:** `ORA-00942` here reads as "the table does not exist", which invites the wrong
diagnosis — the initial reading of this error was that the `atrace` schema was missing. It existed;
it simply could not see `anon_meta.code_map`. The script now carries a comment saying so.

**Is `atrace` required?** Not for OP anonymization. It exists solely so the **unported EPF pipeline**
can keep reading `atrace.ref_tables_modif`, which is the name and shape its phase B expects. It
disappears when EPF is ported — see [../epf/README.md](../epf/README.md).

---

### Things that worked

Worth recording, because they were untested assumptions until this run:

- **Idempotency.** The output shows every object reporting `already exists - kept` / `PRESERVED`,
  which means this was at least the second invocation and the re-run guards behaved exactly as
  designed. `code_map` in particular reported `PRESERVED` — the property the whole restart story
  depends on.
- **Partial failure did not cascade into corruption.** `anon_run` failing left the other five tables
  intact and the script continued, so re-running after the fix simply fills the gap.
- **`&tbs_data` / `&tbs_index` substitution** worked inside `q'[…]'` quoted DDL.
- **Connecting as SYSDBA and running the script by relative path** worked from the copied tree on a
  different machine, which exercises the `%~dp0`-derived paths that were broken throughout v3.

---

### Actions

| # | Action | Status |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | Rename `mode` → `run_mode` in 4 files | ✅ done |
| 2 | Grant `atrace` SELECT on `code_map` `WITH GRANT OPTION` | ✅ done |
| 3 | Re-run A1 on TANM7881 with the fixed script | ⏳ next |
| 4 | Continue from A2 | ⏳ |

Both fixes are safe to apply to the partially-created schema — the script keeps what exists and
creates only what is missing.

---

### Defect T3 — aggregate alias shadowed its own column 🔴 BLOCKER — fixed

```
931/17  PL/SQL: SQL Statement ignored
935/27  PL/SQL: ORA-00935: group function is nested too deeply
936/10  PL/SQL: Statement ignored
936/25  PLS-00364: loop index variable 'T' use is invalid
950/17  PL/SQL: SQL Statement ignored
954/27  PL/SQL: ORA-00935: group function is nested too deeply
955/10  PL/SQL: Statement ignored
955/26  PLS-00364: loop index variable 'G' use is invalid
```

**Where:** `op/sql/30_install_engine.sql`, both grouped cursor loops in `apply_inventory`.

**Cause:** the query read

```sql
SELECT table_name, MIN(seq) AS seq
  FROM anon_meta.anon_inventory
 GROUP BY table_name
 ORDER BY MIN(seq)          -- <-- "seq" here resolves to the ALIAS
```

In `ORDER BY`, Oracle resolves an unqualified name to the **select-list alias** before the base
column. The alias `seq` *is* `MIN(seq)`, so `ORDER BY MIN(seq)` became `ORDER BY MIN(MIN(seq))` —
hence `ORA-00935: group function is nested too deeply`.

`PLS-00364` on loop variables `T` and `G` is pure cascade: the cursor query failed to parse, so the
loop record had no type and every `t.table_name` reference was invalid. **Eight reported errors, two
root causes — one per loop.**

**Fix:** dropped the aliased aggregate from the select list entirely. It was never read — the loops
only use `table_name`, `category` and `rule`. `ORDER BY MIN(seq)` on a `GROUP BY` query is valid
without the column being selected, and with no alias in scope the name resolves to the base column.

The rule is now stated in a comment above the loop, since it is easy to reintroduce.

**Audit done as a result:** swept every SQL file for `AGG(x) AS x` shadowing and for aggregates in
`ORDER BY`. The only other one is `monitor_op_progress.sql:66` (`ORDER BY MIN(logged_at)`), whose
select list has no colliding alias — correct as written.

Also ran a package-wide declaration audit while the compiler was unavailable: all 15 package globals
declared, all spec constants declared, all 23 internal procedures and functions defined, and no
undeclared local variables in any procedure.

### Actions (updated)

| # | Action | Status |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | Rename `mode` → `run_mode` in 4 files | ✅ done |
| 2 | Grant `atrace` SELECT on `code_map` `WITH GRANT OPTION` | ✅ done |
| 3 | Re-run A1 | ✅ **PASS** — `created anon_meta.anon_run`, all 6 tables present |
| 4 | Remove aggregate-alias shadowing in `apply_inventory` | ✅ done |
| 5 | Re-run A2 — package body must compile `VALID` | ⏳ next |
| 6 | Continue to Stage B (baseline capture) | ⏳ |

---

### A2 — package body compiles ✅

After T3, both `ANON_ENGINE` PACKAGE and PACKAGE BODY report `VALID`, `all_errors` empty.

### Stage B — baseline captured ✅

| Category | Codes |
|---|---:|
| ENTITY | 76 |
| PORTFOLIO | 32 |
| COUNTERPARTY | 761 |
| BANK_ACCOUNT | 2,016 |

`op.tiers` 869 rows, `op.compte_banque` 2,016 rows. Sample values recorded locally by the tester
(real client data — not reproduced here).

`compte_banque` codes are 8 characters (`SDFFCCFA`); `tiers` codes are 4 (`REAL`, `SDME`). Both
comfortably above the 1-character checkbox threshold and below what the target columns must hold, so
neither the flag-column rule nor `MIN_CODE_LENGTH` should exclude anything real. Worth re-checking
against preflight once the dry run gets that far.

**B1/B2 reported 0 tables in scope** — expected. Those scripts read `anon_meta.anon_inventory`, which
is only populated by a run. They were executed before the first dry run, so the inventory was empty.
Re-run them after C1 succeeds to get the real numbers.

---

### Defect T4 — inventory load fails with ORA-01756 🔴 BLOCKER — under investigation

```
=== Coverage inventory ===
ERROR:
ORA-01756: quoted string not properly terminated
```

The batch reported `579 inventory items prepared`, so the CSV parse produced the expected count.
The failure is in SQL*Plus, loading the generated INSERT file.

**Ruled out by inspection:**

- Both CSVs are pure ASCII with **no quote characters at all in data rows** (apostrophes appear only
  in `#` comment lines, which `eol=#` skips).
- Simulating the batch tokenizer exactly — `eol=#`, blank-line skip, `delims=,` with consecutive
  delimiters collapsed, `tokens=1-5*` — produces 579 statements, every one with exactly 12 single
  quotes. No odd counts, no unbalanced strings.
- `DELETE FROM anon_meta.anon_inventory` is the only statement between the `=== Coverage inventory ===`
  banner and the generated file, and it contains no quotes.

So the fault is in the **load plumbing**, not the inventory content.

**Changes made to isolate it:**

1. **Removed one level of indirection.** The generated file was `@`-included from *inside*
   `20_load_inventory.sql`, which had itself been `@@`-included by the orchestrator, with the path
   arriving through a second `DEFINE` from `&1`. When that fails, the error names neither the file
   nor the line. `20_load_inventory.sql` now only clears the table; the orchestrator runs the
   generated file directly and `21_validate_inventory.sql` validates afterwards.

2. **The resolved path is now echoed** before the load: `PROMPT Inventory file: &inventory_data`.
   This also tests something never yet proven — that SQL\*Plus resolves **multi-digit positional
   parameters**. Everything that has worked so far used `&1`–`&9`; the inventory path arrives as
   `&22`. If `&22` were parsed as `&2` followed by a literal `2`, the path would come out as the SYS
   password with `2` appended.

3. **The generated file is kept when the run fails**, and its location printed, instead of being
   deleted unconditionally. A failed run should leave its inputs behind.

**Next:** re-run C1 and read the `Inventory file:` line, then the first lines of the kept file.

### Defect T4 — RESOLVED: cmd leaks substring-replacement text on undefined variables 🔴 BLOCKER

**Root cause found from the generated file**, which the tester recovered. Rows with a note were
correct; rows **without** one were not:

```sql
-- row with a note - correct
... ,'CUSTOM','was Cpte1',577);

-- row with an empty note - BROKEN, three quotes
... ,'BASE',''=',1);
```

`''='` is an odd number of quotes, so the **first** `INSERT` raised `ORA-01756`. Roughly 500 of the
579 rows have no note, so most of the file was malformed.

**Cause:** this line, applied to every row:

```bat
set "NTS=!NTS:'=!"
```

When `NTS` is **undefined**, cmd does not perform the replacement — it emits the
`search=replace` text as a literal. Confirmed by direct experiment on this platform:

```
[raw]         NTS=[]
[after strip] NTS=['=]        <-- from an empty variable
```

So an empty notes field became the literal `'=`, which the template then wrapped in quotes as
`''='`.

**Why the analysis kept missing it:** every check was aimed at the *inventory*, and the inventory was
never at fault. Both CSVs are clean ASCII with no quote characters in any data row, and a simulation
of the tokenizer produced 579 perfectly balanced statements. The corruption was introduced *after*
parsing, by the sanitising step itself. **The fix that mattered was keeping the generated file on
failure** — one look at it identified the cause immediately.

**Fix:** guard the replacement.

```bat
if defined NTS set "NTS=!NTS:'=!"
```

Verified on this platform: empty → `''`, value preserved when present, apostrophe still stripped.

**Wider finding — this affects BOTH substring forms.** A follow-up experiment showed
position-based substring leaks the same way:

```
!UNDEF:~0,1!   ->  ~0,1        (not empty)
!UNDEF:x=y!    ->  x=y         (not empty)
```

An earlier note in this log claimed position substring was safe on undefined variables. **That was
wrong.** Every `!var:...!` expansion in the batch file is now guarded with `if defined`, including
the two `~0,1` uses that were safe only by accident of ordering.

**Rule for this codebase:** never write `!var:...!` without `if defined var` in front of it, for
either form.

## Dry run — PASS

```
resolved .......... 427
missing tables .... 68
missing columns ... 79
checkbox columns .. 4   (left alone)
too narrow ........ 0
wrong type ........ 0
not nullable ...... 1
errors ............ 0
rows affected ..... 10,663,242   (would change)
step time ......... 20s
```

579 loaded / 562 shipped / 17 site-specific — all three match. The rule and category breakdown
matches the CSV exactly. 167 tables in scope, ~115M rows.

The counts reconcile: 427 resolved + 68 missing-table rows + 79 missing-column rows + 4 checkbox
+ 1 not-nullable = 579. The 6 absent tables (`CM_DEAL_DEAL`, `CM_PAYT_PAYMENT`,
`CM_CMS_EXCEPTIONS`, `VAL_CPTYRATING`, `VUE_AFFILIE_COMPTE`, `VUE_AFFILIE_TIERS`) account for the 68
rows — `cm_deal_deal` alone holds 32 of them.

---

### Finding T5 — three inventory rows are misclassified 🟠 no action needed, but worth knowing

Preflight flagged four checkbox columns. One was expected. **Three were not:**

```
CHECKBOX ventiler_corresp_bqe.tiers_entite  (VARCHAR2(1)) - will be left alone
CHECKBOX val_ssi_account.tiers_entite       (VARCHAR2(1)) - will be left alone
CHECKBOX val_ssi_corresp.tiers_entite       (VARCHAR2(1)) - will be left alone
CHECKBOX tiers.flag_pp                      (VARCHAR2(1)) - will be left alone
```

`tiers.flag_pp` is the known case — a natural-person checkbox that the old `config.ini` listed as
an anonymizable attribute via `Fold4`.

The three `tiers_entite` columns are more interesting. They are declared `CODE` / `ANY` in the
inventory, inherited from v3's `merge_codes` calls — meaning v3 treated them as **references to an
entity or counterparty code**. But they are `VARCHAR2(1)` on this instance, and codes here are 4
characters (`REAL`, `SDME`) or 8 (`SDFFCCFA`). **A one-character column cannot hold any of them.**

The name reads differently in that light: `tiers_entite` is almost certainly a **discriminator** —
`'T'` or `'E'`, saying which kind of thing the neighbouring column refers to — not a reference
itself.

**No action taken.** The engine already skips them, so behaviour is correct either way, and the
checkbox rule caught the misclassification without needing the inventory to be right. Recorded for
the developer review as evidence that the width rule earns its place: it found three rows that
sixteen years of the previous tool had been feeding into `merge_codes`.

If a code of one character had ever existed, v3 would have overwritten these discriminators
schema-wide.

---

### Finding T6 — one free-text column cannot be emptied 🟠 verifier adjusted

```
NOT NULL histo_pricing_groupe.description (cannot be emptied)
```

`histo_pricing_groupe.description` is `NULL_OUT` in the inventory but `NOT NULL` on this schema. The
engine skips it rather than failing the run with `ORA-01407`, as designed.

**But the verifier would have failed on it**, because PART 2 asserts every `NULL_OUT` column is
entirely empty. A correct run would have reported `FAIL` — which is both wrong and the kind of thing
that trains people to ignore verification output.

**Fixed:** PART 2 now detects `NOT NULL` columns and reports them as `WARN` with the reason and the
remedy, consistent with how checkbox columns are handled. The gap stays visible; it no longer fails
a run that behaved correctly.

**The gap is real:** the free text in that column is still there. Options are to change its rule to
`SELF_CODE` so it is overwritten rather than emptied, or accept it knowingly. See
[08_open_questions.md](08_open_questions.md) item 7.

---

### Defect T7 — first EXECUTE attempt lost its connection 🔵 environmental, re-run

```
Inventory file: C:\Users\...\anon_inventory_5830.sql
=== Coverage inventory ===
ERROR:
ORA-03114: not connected to ORACLE
```

**Not a code defect.** `ORA-03114` means the session was gone. The script had already connected as
SYS, created the metadata schema, reconnected as OP and compiled the package (`No errors.` twice) —
all of which require a live session. It then died on the first statement afterwards.

**Nothing was changed.** The failure came before the inventory load, which is before `start_run` and
long before any DML. No run row, no mapping change, no data touched.

Usual causes: the server process crashed, the session was killed, a profile idle limit expired, or
the network dropped. Worth checking the alert log around the timestamp for `ORA-00600` / `ORA-07445`
or a shutdown.

**Change made:** the orchestrator now asserts its connection immediately after connecting as OP:

```sql
SELECT 'Connected as ' || USER || ' on ' || ... FROM dual;
```

`SET TERMOUT OFF` around the `CONNECT` hides a failed logon, and SQL*Plus does not reliably treat one
as a `SQLERROR` — so without this a bad connect surfaces later as `ORA-03114` on whatever statement
runs next, naming the wrong culprit. Now the run states which user and instance it is on before
doing anything.

### Defect T7 (revised) — ORA-03114 at the inventory reload 🔵 still open

Failed identically **after an instance restart**, at exactly the same point:

```
Connected as OP on TANM7881 (session 869)
No errors.
No errors.
Inventory file: C:\Users\...\anon_inventory_13729.sql
=== Coverage inventory ===
ERROR:
ORA-03114: not connected to ORACLE
```

The connection assertion added for the previous attempt worked — the run confirms it is OP on
TANM7881, session 869 — so the session was alive after connecting and stayed alive long enough to
compile the package. It dies on the first server round trip afterwards.

**Locks were found on `ANON_META.ANON_INVENTORY`** (sessions 381 and 869, both `OP`, Row-X). Session
869 is the failing run's own session, identified by the new assertion.

**Two facts argue against locks being the root cause:**

1. **Sessions do not survive an instance restart.** The restart cleared every session and every
   lock, and the very next run failed identically. On that attempt there was no pre-existing holder.
   The locks found afterwards were left *by* the failed run, not encountered *by* it.
2. **A blocked DELETE hangs; it does not raise ORA-03114.** Oracle DML has no default lock timeout,
   so a row-lock conflict makes the statement wait indefinitely. Something would have had to kill
   the session mid-wait to turn that into ORA-03114.

So locks are a real problem worth defending against, but most likely a symptom.

**Defences added regardless** — they turn a hang into a named error either way:

- `20_load_inventory.sql` now takes the table lock explicitly with `LOCK TABLE … IN EXCLUSIVE MODE
  WAIT 10` before the DELETE. On `ORA-00054` it names the holding session and the exact
  `ALTER SYSTEM KILL SESSION` needed. A run can no longer hang silently on this table.
- `tests/manual/check_locks.sql` reports holders, idle times, ready-to-paste kill statements, all OP
  sessions, and any blocking chain in the instance.

**Still to determine.** The decisive test is the DELETE on its own, in a fresh session:

```sql
SET TIMING ON
DELETE FROM anon_meta.anon_inventory;
COMMIT;
```

- completes instantly → not a lock; the fault is in the script context around the package compile
- hangs → lock contention confirmed
- ORA-03114 → the session is dying for an unrelated reason; check the alert log for `ORA-00600`,
  `ORA-07445`, `ORA-04030` around the failure time

```sql
SELECT name, value FROM v$diag_info WHERE name IN ('Diag Trace','Diag Alert');
```

**Note for the record:** the earlier troubleshooting summary stated "sessions survive restart". They
do not. That line should not be carried into any runbook.

---

## Stage D — EXECUTE, PASS (run 2)

Run from a Windows server **on the same network as the database**. No errors.

| | |
|---|---|
| Mappings | 2,885 — entity 76, portfolio 32, counterparty 761, account 2,016 |
| Applied | 156 statements, 44,460,155 rows |
| Errors | 0 |
| Runtime | 1,757s (~29 min), inside the 20–40 min estimate |
| Triggers | 45 disabled → 45 re-enabled |

Mapping counts **match the Stage B baseline exactly** — checklist item C5, the check that proves the
four mapping source queries select the right populations.

### Defect T7 — RESOLVED: the network, not the code

Every `ORA-03114` was a dropped client connection between the workstation and the database. Same
code, same instance, same credentials, run from a host on the same network: clean.

Three hypotheses were pursued and discarded first — zombie locks, the 579-row DELETE, session
exhaustion. The through-line that should have been followed sooner: **manual execution of the same
statements succeeded, and the reported failure point moved between runs.** Both were visible early
and both point outside the code. `ORA-03114` ("not connected") rather than `ORA-03113`
("end-of-file") was the specific tell — the client had already lost the connection before the
statement that reported it.

Nothing in the code fixed this. The `TRUNCATE` and lock-timeout changes are worth keeping on their
own merits, but neither addressed the cause.

---

## Stage E — verification

`verify_op_coverage.sql`: **432 passed, 0 failed.** 462 identifier columns with no residual
originals, 92 free-text columns empty, 25 labels consistent. Row counts unchanged (869 / 2,016).
`flag_pp` untouched. 45 triggers enabled.

432 checked + 147 absent = 579 — every inventory row accounted for.

---

### Defect T8 — the verifier shared the engine's blind spot, and a real leak survived

**Found by an independent check, after the standard verification reported PASS.**

```
param_cpta_reg_gen.compte_ana     5
columns with residual originals: 1
```

Five rows still held **original client identifiers**.

**Cause.** The column is declared `CODE` / `BANK_ACCOUNT`, inherited from v3's
`merge_codes('param_cpta_reg_gen','compte_ana', p_entity_type => 'COMPTE')`. The engine therefore
substituted only bank-account codes. Those five values belong to a different category, so they were
never touched.

`compte_ana` is *compte analytique* — an analytical / cost-centre account, not a bank account. v3
classified it from the word `compte` in the name.

**Why verification missed it.** PART 1 restricted its residual search **the same way the engine
did** — bank-account codes only, for a `BANK_ACCOUNT` column. Engine and verifier shared one wrong
assumption, so both agreed and both were wrong. A verifier that re-applies the engine's assumptions
cannot detect an assumption that is itself wrong.

This contradicted the principle stated in the script's own header — that the check tests the
*outcome*, not the method — and it took an independent query to expose it.

**Fixes:**

1. **PART 1 now searches the full mapping** for every `CODE` column whatever its declared category.
   Any original left anywhere is a leak. A failing `BANK_ACCOUNT` column names the likely cause and
   the remedy.
2. **`param_cpta_reg_gen.compte_ana` corrected to `CODE,ANY`** in `inventory_op_custom.csv`.
3. **The loader now supports overrides.** `anon_inventory` has a primary key on
   `(table_name, column_name)`, so a second row for the same column previously raised `ORA-00001`
   instead of taking effect. Custom rows now emit a `DELETE` first, so a wrong classification in the
   shipped inventory can be corrected without editing it.

**Why `ANY`:** `code_map_any` contains every category, so genuine bank account references still
resolve to `CB_`. Only the six cross-category collisions resolve differently.

---

### The six cross-category collisions — reviewed, correct

```
BNPSP      counterparty T_0000116   account CB_0000088   ANY columns got T_0000116
ENCON      entity       E_0000008   account CB_0000267   ANY columns got E_0000008

Bank accounts named after their owner. An entity and its account are different objects in different
tables, so they anonymize differently — the collision guard working as intended, and the same
behaviour v3 had.

Resolution follows the documented priority: entity → portfolio → counterparty → account. Account
always loses in an `ANY` column, matching every row above.

**Blast radius is exactly bounded:** an `ANY`-classified column referencing a bank account and
holding one of these six codes. Every other code in the 2,885-entry mapping resolves identically
everywhere, guaranteed by the primary key on `code_map_any` and the unique index on
`code_map.new_code`.

## Runs 3 and 4 — the `compte_ana` correction, applied

The five values in `param_cpta_reg_gen.compte_ana` were confirmed as **counterparty** codes:

```sql
SELECT m.category, COUNT(*) FROM op.param_cpta_reg_gen t
  JOIN anon_meta.code_map m ON m.old_code = t.compte_ana GROUP BY m.category;
-- COUNTERPARTY   5
```

So the column holds counterparty references, not bank accounts — `compte analytique`, misclassified
by v3 from the word `compte`. `CODE,ANY` confirmed correct by data rather than by inference.

### Run 3 — dry run

```
cleared anon_meta.anon_inventory (579 rows)
loaded ............ 579 items
  shipped ......... 561
  site-specific ... 18
...
param_cpta_reg_gen.compte_ana        DRYRUN    5 rows would change
```

Mapping: all four categories `REUSED`. Everything else 0. 28s, no errors.

**The override accounting is the thing to notice.** Shipped fell 562 → 561 and site-specific rose
17 → 18, total unchanged at 579: the shipped row for `compte_ana` was replaced by the custom one.
That is the `DELETE`-before-`INSERT` added for exactly this, working.

### Run 4 — execute

```
param_cpta_reg_gen.compte_ana        OK        5 rows
```

**That is the only item that reported `OK` in the entire run.** Everything else `NOOP` or `SKIPPED`.

```
applied ........... 3          (compte_ana + two trigger steps)
no rows matched ... 389
skipped ........... 304
errors ............ 0
rows affected ..... 2,980
step time ......... 11s
```

`rows affected` reconciles exactly: 2,885 mapping reuse + 45 triggers off + 45 triggers on + 5 real
updates. Triggers 45 → 45.

### What these two runs prove

- **The dry run is trustworthy.** It predicted exactly one change; the execute made exactly that one
  change and nothing else. Predicted and actual agree at the level of individual columns.
- **Restartability works on real data.** All four categories `REUSED`, every previously-applied item
  `NOOP`, only genuinely-outstanding work performed. This is the property v3 lacked — and it is what
  would have saved a run interrupted by the network drops in T7.
- **11s versus the first run's 1,757s is expected.** The first run physically rewrote 44.5M rows;
  this one had 5 to change and the rest evaluated to no-ops.
- **Custom rows can correct the shipped inventory** without editing it.

## Post-verification hardening

Final verification on TANM7881: **432 passed, 0 failed, 1 warning.** PART 1 — 462 identifier columns
checked against the **full** mapping — 0 residual. `param_cpta_reg_gen.compte_ana` now clean.

Three follow-ups, all from reviewing that output rather than from a failure.

### Step-log counters double-counted 🟡 fixed

`skipped 304` described **152** actual objects. `log_step` incremented the run counters for every
call, and preflight reports on all 579 inventory items *before* the apply phase reports on the same
items again — so each missing object was counted twice.

Preflight entries are now logged but **not counted**. The summary describes the work done, so it
counts the phases that do work: `MAPPING`, `NULL_OUT`, `CODE`, `DESCRIPTION`, `SELF_CODE`,
`TRIGGERS`. Preflight keeps its own separate summary, which was always correct.

### `NOT NULL` free text is now masked rather than left alone 🟢 gap closed

`histo_pricing_groupe.description` is `NULL_OUT` in the inventory but `NOT NULL` on this schema.
`SET … = NULL` raises `ORA-01407`, so the engine skipped it — leaving real free text in place and
the verifier reporting a permanent `WARN`.

`SELF_CODE` is not an alternative: it writes *the row's own identifier*, which needs a `code` column
on the table, and the `histo_*` tables do not have one.

So the engine now **overwrites with a fixed marker** — `ANONYMIZED`, truncated to the column width.
The client content is removed, which is the point, and the constraint stays satisfied. The predicate
excludes rows already masked, so a re-run remains a no-op.

Only a `NOT NULL` **non-character** column is now skipped, since a marker cannot be written to one.
That still reports `WARN`.

The verifier accepts either outcome — empty or masked — as clean.

**This shares a definition with the engine, not an assumption.** Knowing what an anonymized value
looks like is the same kind of knowledge as knowing the `E_`/`P_`/`T_`/`CB_` prefixes. It is not
knowing *where to look*, which is what caused T8.

### The T8 lesson recorded for the EPF port 🟢

[epf/README.md](../epf/README.md) now opens with it: **a verifier that re-applies the engine's
assumptions can only ever confirm them.** Share definitions, never scope or restrictions; search the
full mapping regardless of declared category; let the check be stricter than the run.

EPF has more such restrictions than OP, not fewer — BIC components matched by sub-field, payment
amounts by numeric range, orphan codes via a synthetic mapping. Each is a place the same blind spot
could reappear.
